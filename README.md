# grunt-repos [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-repos.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-repos) 

> Grunt task to download a list of repos from GitHub's API

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-repos --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-repos');
```

If the plugin has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list the newly-installed plugin's task or tasks. In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.



## The "repos" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `repos` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  repos: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    }
  }
})
```


### Options
### path
Type: `String`
Default: `/orgs/assemble/`

List repositories for the specified org.

### filterBy
Type: `String`
Default: `name`

The property to use to filter the collection. This option works in conjunction with `options.include` and `options.exclude`.

### exclude
Type: `String|Array`
Default: `undefined`

Keywords to use for excluding repos from the returned array. If the property defined using `filterBy` contains any values with excluded keywords, the repo will be omitted from the list.

### include
Type: `String|Array`
Default: `undefined`

Keywords to use for whitelisting repos in the returned array. Unless excluded, if the property defined using `filterBy` contains any values with these keywords, the repo will be included in the list.

### sortBy
Type: `String`
Default: `name`

The property by which to sort the collection.

### sortOrder
Type: `String`
Default: `asc`

The order in which to sort the collection.
